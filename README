lucky.rb outputs a Markdown-formatted link to the top hit on Google for a given search string. I wrote it to use in MacOS X with Automator + Services so that I could have a global keyboard shortcut that would replace a string with its "I'm Feeling Lucky" result-- handy for writing blog posts, comments, etc.

To use lucky.rb, you'll need to have an API key to use the AJAX API.
You can get one here: http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/signup.html

Create ~/.google_key:
line 1: API key
line 2: the "website URL" you entered when signing up

Then you should be good to go.

If for some reason you don't want to store your key in that location, you can use the --credentials FILE command line option to point to a different path. If you don't want to keep the key in a separate file at all, you can use "-k KEY:URL" or "--key KEY:URL" to enter them on the command line.
